1 
00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:9,220 
 Amidst the city's bustle, James sits silently in his car, the radio off. 

2 
00:00:9,220 --> 00:00:15,520 
 His mind wanders to the carefree days of youth, laughter echoing from the past. 

3 
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,520 
 As he waits at a zebra crossing, a pristine red Camry pulls alongside. 

4 
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,080 
 The sight sparks memories of wild nights and fast cars with old friends. 

5 
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,120 
 At the school gates, his niece Charlotte bursts forth her joy infectious. 

6 
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,080 
 Uncle Jimmy, she exclaims, leaping into his arms. 

7 
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,040 
 Their bond is immediate and full of warmth. 

8 
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,920 
 Driving away, Charlotte chatters excitedly in the back seat, 

9 
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,080 
 her story's painting pictures of her day. 

10 
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,880 
 James listens, his heart swelling with love. 

11 
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,480 
 Their next stop is the quaint home of James's aging parents. 

12 
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:0,400 
 Inside, the air is filled with the comfortable familiarity of family love and 

13 
00:01:0,400 --> 00:01:5,840 
 gentle care with grandparents, groceries and Charlotte in tow. 

14 
00:01:5,840 --> 00:01:9,560 
 The family car is a scene of joyful chaos. 

15 
00:01:9,560 --> 00:01:13,560 
 They play a guessing game, laughter filling the air. 

16 
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,240 
 Suddenly, the mood shatters. 

17 
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,720 
 A truck collides with their car, screams pierce the air, 

18 
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,880 
 metal crunches and in moments, lives change forever. 

19 
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,000 
 In the eerie silence that follows, James, dazed and injured, 

20 
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,600 
 tries to comprehend the devastation. 

21 
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,400 
 As he looks up, he sees the red Camry again. 

22 
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,720 
 It's driver now a witness to his deepest loss.
