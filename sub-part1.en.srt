00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:10,400 
 The sun rose over the sleepy town of Abeokuta, where Iyabo Oni began her first day as a teacher. 

2 
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,000 
 Dressed impeccably in a tailored skirt suit, her most noticeable accessory was a pair of 

3 
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,800 
 shiny red heels, a gift from her mother. 

4 
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:29,440 
 As she walked by, the sound of her heels, koi, koi, koi, koi, echoed, turning heads 

5 
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,040 
 and drawing whispers from students. 

6 
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,040 
 Her teaching style was strict. 

7 
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,360 
 Her methods, often called harsh, drew mixed reactions from her fellow teachers and students 

8 
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360 
 alike. 

9 
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,280 
 The turning point in Iyabo's life occurred on a Tuesday afternoon when her fiancÃ©e, 

10 
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,040 
 Adeola, a lawyer from Lagos, appeared at the school. 

11 
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:58,280 
 Iyabo was summoned to the principal's office, where Adeola said he could not go through 

12 
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,680 
 with the marriage. 

13 
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:6,120 
 Iyabo's legs gave way as she fell in a mix of shock and despair. 

14 
00:01:6,120 --> 00:01:11,240 
 The news of the broken engagement spread through the school like wildfire. 

15 
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:19,100 
 She felt the weight of every whisper and sideways glance from both students and teachers. 

16 
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,160 
 She began to perceive the laughter of students as mocking, and one day she could not take 

17 
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,240 
 it any longer.
