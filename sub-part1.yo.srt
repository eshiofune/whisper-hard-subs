 The sun rose over the sleepy town of Abeokuta, where Iyabu Oni began her first day as a teacher. Dressed impeccably in a tailored skirt suit, her most noticeable accessory was a pair of shiny red heels, a gift from her mother.

 As she walked by, the sound of her heels, koi, koi, koi, koi, ekkoad, turning heads and drawing whispers from students. Her teaching style was strict. Her methods, often called hash, drew mixed reactions from her fellow teachers and students alike.

 Iyabu's legs gave way, as she fell in a mix of shock and despair. The news of the broken engagement spread through the school like wildfire. She felt the weight of every whisper and sideways glance from both students and teachers. She began to perceive the laughter of students as mocking, and one day she could not take it any longer.
