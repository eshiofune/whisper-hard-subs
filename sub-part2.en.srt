00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:7,200 
 One fateful day, during a stressful examination period, Iyabo caught a student cheating. 

2 
00:00:7,200 --> 00:00:13,280 
 In a moment of intense anger, she struck the student, causing a severe injury. 

3 
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,240 
 The repercussions were immediate, and she was dismissed from her position. 

4 
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,800 
 Humiliated and enraged, she blamed the students for her downfall, vowing revenge against them. 

5 
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,800 
 On her journey back home, Iyabo was involved in a severe accident. 

6 
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,440 
 Her last moments were consumed by thoughts of vengeance and betrayal. 

7 
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,600 
 Her spirit, unable to find peace, became tied to the school where she felt her dreams had 

8 
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,200 
 been destroyed. 

9 
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:52,240 
 Not long after her death, students and teachers began to report strange and scary occurrences. 

10 
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,240 
 Doors would slam shut. 

11 
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:1,240 
 A single red heel was found in classrooms, and the unmistakable sound of her heels, koi, 

12 
00:01:1,240 --> 00:01:7,440 
 koi, koi, koi, was heard through empty hallways at night. 

13 
00:01:7,440 --> 00:01:10,840 
 The legend of Madam Koi Koi was born.
